# Ticket Management Database

This project shows how to create a simple database for storing support tickets.

### What this is:
A sample project to show:
- How a ticket table works
- Fields like ticket_id, user_name, issue, status, created_date
- Basic SQL insert, update and select queries

### What I did:
- Created a sample ticket table
- Inserted dummy ticket data
- Ran queries to filter by status (open/closed)
- Designed a simple workflow of how tickets move from "Open → In Progress → Closed"

### Why this project:
This shows basic database understanding, which is useful for Analyst Trainee roles.
